## General Questions

While these questions are not included under the specific roles, you might consider doing some additional research or thinking about these areas depending on the role or company you are interviewing for. Please review the file.

## Own Project

Explain a recent project you've worked on. Why did you choose this project? What difficulties did you run into this project that you did not expect, and how did you solve them? Furthermore, use the skills you learned in the previous projects toward a novel solution to another problem in this area!

## Question Follow-ups

Normally the interviewers have follow-up questions to extend their original questions, or to clarify something the candidate discussed. You should also clearly denote at least one potential relevant follow-up question for each question, and also provide a sufficient answer for it.
