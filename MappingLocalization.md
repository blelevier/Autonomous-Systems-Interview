## Questions

- How does Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) differ from other localization approaches? What are the benefits and detriments of this over other approaches?
- [Code] Describe how a particle filter works, where it is useful, and how it performs against similar algorithms. Code an example of how you update the weights of the particles between steps.
- Describe the differences between dense mapping vs. sparse mapping. In what situations would you prefer the use of one over the other?
- [Code] Sparse mapping involves the use of “landmarks” in your map to assist with determining where your robot is in the environment. Given a set of detections and a map of landmarks (you may create a test set of these, which should not exactly match up), code a method to estimate where your robot is.
- Image-based localization concerns utilizing only camera images in order to determine location in an environment. Explain a method to implement such a system, as well as what the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach are.
- [Code] Why would you utilize an inertial measurement unit (IMU) in conjunction with GPS in localizing a moving robot? Implement a basic system that uses these together for accurate localization.
- [Code] How does GNSS+RTK (real-time kinematic) allow for higher accuracy than standard GPS systems? Implement a basic system that shows how this technique works.
- [Code] You have a robot in an environment with certain known landmarks, but its current position is unknown. Code a method to detect its new location over time when the robot has perfect movement and noisy sensor data. What would you need to change in this function if the robot's motion is also noisy?
